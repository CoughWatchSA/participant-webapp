##   Background and mission of the program

CoughWatchSA is a participatory surveillance program developed by the
Centre for Respiratory Diseases and Meningitis from the National
Institute for Communicable Diseases. Our aim is to conduct surveillance
for communicable respiratory diseases within South Africa in order to
provide data on the burden, severity and seasonality.

Our mission is to develop a real-time surveillance program for
non-medically attended cases of influenza-like illness (ILI) as reported
by members of the community. We want to systematically collect data on
health-seeking behaviour, vaccination coverage and trends of reported
suspected cases of ILI. In so doing, we hope to develop an early warning
system for identifying suspected cases of ILI directly from the
community, without needing a visit to a clinic or hospital. Our data
will complement existing facility-based surveillance program to better
understand the broader community burden of respiratory illness.

##   Program\'s achievements and impact

The first pilot of CoughWatchSA was launch on 9 March 2022 and received
a widespread interest from the media, members of the local and
international community. The aim of the launch was to pilot the methods
of digital participatory surveillance and assess the acceptability and
feasibility of using this program for respiratory illness in South
Africa. The second object was to assess the feasibility of linking
eligible participants to home-based testing for influenzas and COVID19.

We reached **954** volunteers who accessed the platform, where
**249(26%)** successfully enrolled in the study. A majority of the
enrolled participants were women **178(71%)** and the largest age group
was 30-39 years **93(37%)**. Among enrolled participants, **62(25%)**
reported seasonal influenza vaccine receipt in 2022 and **212(85%)** had
received at least 1 dose of COVID-19 vaccine. We received a total of 1440
symptoms reports over 29 weeks of deployment, with an average of 50 weekly symptom
reports sumbitted. We were able to determine **31(2%)** and **110(8%)** suspected 
ILI cases with and without fever, respectively. We determined 359(25%) suspected
COVID19 cases overall. Due to small enrolment numbers and inconsistent
participation, we could not determine a significant correlation between reported
data from CoughWatchSA and laboratory data. A total of **88/249(36%)**
participants were eligible for home-based testing, and **81/88(92%)**
were successfully enrolled. We detected **6/81(7%)** influenza and
**26(32%)** SARS-CoV-2 infections

Although the number of enrolled individuals was low, the study
demonstrated the potential of obtaining data on non-medically attended
ILI and COVID-19 cases. The platform has a potential to provide good
vaccine coverage data for seasonal influenza and COVID19. Linkage to
home-based testing was successful and demonstrates the potential for
self-swabbing and real-time detection of influenza and COVID-19. This
platform could complement sentinel surveillance to provide a better
estimate of the community epidemiology of respiratory illness. Our aim
this year is to polite a new platform using a web application, attract
and retain more participants to strengthen the value of this
surveillance program.
